# Fossil Fighters Colosseum

A Fossil Fighters team-builder and battle simulator. This project is currently in an incomplete state.

## Running
  1) Download and install [godot 3](https://godotengine.org/download/). Many linux distributions maintain the game engine in their [package repositories](https://repology.org/project/godot/versions) as well.

  2) Clone this repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/apsis12/ffcolosseum
```

  3) [Download the asset pack](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1mmnDvbb4Qh3coSmmhaAq_m5HXdcsM4nj?usp=sharing), move it to the `FossilFightersColosseum` directory, and rename it to `Assets`.

  4) Open the godot project manager and register the project's directory by clicking `Scan` and navigating the file dialogue. Once inside the editor, run the project by pressing `<f5>` or clicking the play button on the top-right.

## Notes
- The team names `Main` and `Enemy` represent the player's team and the AI opponent's team, respectively. If no saved teams exist with those names, they are randomly generated.
